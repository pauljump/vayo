## Example:

### Hypothesis
Renters will pay $4.99 for a Carfax-style apartment report.

### Success Metrics
- 10%+ conversion from free preview to paid report
- Average time-on-report: 2+ minutes
- 50%+ say it helped negotiation in follow-up survey

### Method
1. Build free preview (fairness score visible)
2. Paywall full report ($4.99)
3. Share in r/NYCapartments
4. Track: views, conversions, time-on-page
5. Email survey to buyers: "Did this help?"

### Duration
14 days (2 weeks of traffic)

### Results
- 147 free previews viewed
- 8 purchased full report (5.4% conversion)
- Avg time: 3m 42s
- Survey: 6/8 responded, 5/6 said "very helpful", 1 saved $150

### Learning
Conversion below target (5.4% vs. 10%) but engagement high.
Price may be barrier OR need better preview/CTA.

### Decision
[x] Validated with caveat - price works, need to improve funnel
[ ] Invalidated
[ ] Inconclusive
