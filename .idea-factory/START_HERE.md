# 🚀 First Session Instructions

**You just entered this project.** Here's what to do:

## For You (Human)

Just say to Claude:

```
Read .claude/PROTOCOL.md and start
```

That's it. Claude will:
- ✅ Load the project context
- ✅ Generate custom questions based on your idea
- ✅ Ask you one question at a time
- ✅ Track readiness (0-100%)
- ✅ Generate "perfect prompt" at 100%
- ✅ Build the entire production app

## What Happens

**Phase 1 (0-30%): Core Value**
Questions customized to your project about:
- Who it's for, what pain it solves, why now

**Phase 2 (30-55%): MVP Scope**
Questions about:
- Core features, boundaries, onboarding

**Phase 3 (55-75%): Technical Approach**
Questions adapted to project type:
- Platform, tech stack, APIs, deployment

**Phase 4 (75-90%): Risk Mitigation**
Questions about:
- Assumptions, validation, pricing

**Phase 5 (90-100%): Perfect Prompt**
- Synthesize everything
- Generate build instructions
- You approve → Claude builds

## After First Session

Conversations auto-save to `.claude/conversations/`

Next time you `cd` here:
- Context automatically shown
- Resume where you left off
- No manual commands needed

---

**TL;DR:** Say `"Read .claude/PROTOCOL.md and start"` to begin.
